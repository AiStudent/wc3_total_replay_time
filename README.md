# wc3_total_replay_time
Sums upp the game time in all your replays.

This works for replays from 1.07 and later.

The file isn't long so just edit the path inside the script (I hate making a typo when using the command line).

If you don't have python 3 you can download it from https://www.python.org/. If you have no idea how to run a python script try google. Usually a python editor called "Idle" gets installed with python. From it you can open this python program/file, change the path in the first lines, and run it.
